# Purpose of this repo

Due to recent issues at Udacity while working on their Data Analysis nanodegree, during my R Programming course, I and other students were unable to access our workspaces, so we could not do any of the practice work in R, nor could we work on our final project.

Once the issue was fixed, I downloaded a static copy of every single Jupyter notebook throughout the entire course including the final project template. I've uploaded them here for any other students who run into the issue in the near future. Since this is a static repository that is not maintained by Udacity, I will delete this folder in a few months to ensure future students aren't using outdated copies of the program content. 

This repository is just for current students who may be experiencing the same issue at this time.
